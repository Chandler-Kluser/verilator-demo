# Verilator Demo

Simple repository which uses `Verilator`, `GTKWave`, `make`, `gcc` and `g++` to simulate and output a NAND module in a waveform VCD format.

## Instructions

- Have `Verilator`, `GTKWave`, `make`, `gcc` and `g++` installed in your computer
- Run `make lib`
- Run `make`

## Output

To output the waveform in `GTKWave`, with the project compiled run `make output`.

It is recommended to have `Cascadia Code PL` font installed in your computer for better output result.

## Clean

If you want to clean and use the repository as a template for your project, run `make clean` to delete all generated files.
